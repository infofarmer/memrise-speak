MemriseSpeak.user.js
===========================

Memrise Speak leverages Web Speech API to pronounce words. On Mac OS X
local speech engine is leveraged, which means audio is played instantly
and in relatively high quality.

Current limitations:
- only works in desktop Chrome and Safari
- best works on OS X

Further plans:
- support more languages and synthesis options
- dictation!
