MemriseSpeak.user.js
===========================

Memrise Speak leverages Web Speech API to pronounce words. On Mac OS X
local speech engine is leveraged, which means audio is played instantly
and in relatively high quality.

Current limitations:
- only works in desktop Chrome
- best works on OS X
- tested on a few popular Chinese and Japanese courses
- other languages will need to be added manually
- only tested in review mode

Further plans:
- support all languages
- dictation!
